# FEEDBACKFLOW - PROJECT DEFINITION & HIGH-LEVEL FUNCTIONALITY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
FeedbackFlow is a comprehensive web-based feedback management system for tech organizations. It centralizes all feedback cycles, performance reviews, and continuous feedback processes in one unified platform.

## CORE PURPOSE
- Streamline feedback collection and management across the organization
- Enable 360-degree feedback processes (manager, peer, self, upward reviews)
- Provide actionable insights and analytics for performance improvement
- Facilitate goal setting, tracking, and development planning
- Create transparent and structured feedback workflows

## TECH STACK
- **Frontend**: React 18, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 only
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit / Zustand
- **API Design**: RESTful with comprehensive error handling
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Docker, containerized architecture

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES
- **Modular Design**: Feature-based module organization
- **Event-Driven**: Decoupled components using event emitters
- **Security-First**: RBAC, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Scalable**: Multi-tenant ready, horizontal scaling support
- **Performance**: Pagination, caching, optimized queries
- **Maintainable**: TypeScript, comprehensive testing, clean code

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY MODULES

### 1. AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration only
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- User profile management and preferences
- Organization hierarchy and team structure
- Session management and security

### 2. FEEDBACK CYCLE MANAGEMENT
- Create and configure feedback cycles (annual, quarterly, project-based)
- Cycle templates and workflow automation
- Participant assignment and timeline management
- Automated reminders and deadline tracking
- Cycle completion analytics and reporting

### 3. FEEDBACK & REVIEW SYSTEM
- Multi-type feedback support:
  - Manager-to-Employee reviews
  - Self-assessments
  - Peer reviews (360-degree)
  - Upward feedback (employee-to-manager)
  - Project retrospectives
- Rich feedback content: comments, ratings, goals, recommendations
- Draft/Submit/Complete workflow with validation
- Threaded comments and discussions
- Feedback acknowledgment and action planning

### 4. ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS
- Individual performance trends and growth tracking
- Team and department analytics
- Organization-wide feedback insights
- Goal completion rates and progress tracking
- Custom reports and data visualization
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV, Excel)

### 5. NOTIFICATION & COMMUNICATION
- Multi-channel notifications (email, in-app, Slack)
- Automated deadline reminders and escalations
- Real-time updates and activity feeds
- Customizable notification preferences
- Comment threading and @mentions

### 6. GOAL MANAGEMENT
- SMART goal setting and tracking
- OKR integration and alignment
- Development plan creation
- Progress monitoring and updates
- Goal categorization and prioritization

## USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

### ADMIN (HR/System Admin)
- Full system access and configuration
- Organization setup and user management
- Cycle creation and management across all departments
- System-wide analytics and reporting
- Integration management and settings

### MANAGER
- Team member feedback management
- Cycle participation for direct reports
- Team analytics and insights
- Goal setting and tracking for team members
- Can receive feedback as an employee from their manager

### EMPLOYEE
- Participate in assigned feedback cycles
- Give and receive feedback based on assignments
- Self-assessment completion
- Goal setting and progress tracking
- Personal development planning

## DATA MODELS & RELATIONSHIPS

### Core Entities:
- **Users**: Profile, role, organization hierarchy
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant structure, departments, teams
- **Feedback Cycles**: Templates, timelines, participants
- **Feedback**: Content, ratings, goals, comments, acknowledgments
- **Goals**: Categories, priorities, progress tracking
- **Notifications**: Multi-channel, preferences, delivery status
- **Analytics**: Aggregated data, metrics, insights

### Key Relationships:
- Users belong to Organizations with hierarchical reporting
- Feedback Cycles contain multiple Feedback instances
- Feedback has one-to-many Comments and Goals
- Users can have multiple roles in different contexts
- Managers can be Employees in different feedback relationships

## SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
- Google OAuth 2.0 with workspace domain restrictions
- JWT token-based session management
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- GDPR compliance and data privacy controls
- Audit logging for all user actions
- Rate limiting and API security

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Efficient pagination for large datasets
- Optimized database queries with indexes
- CDN integration for static assets

## INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES
- Google Workspace (OAuth, email, calendar)
- HRIS systems (user sync, org structure)
- Slack (notifications, bot integration)
- Email providers (SMTP, templates)
- Calendar systems (meeting scheduling)
- Export to BI tools and analytics platforms

## DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Unit test coverage > 90%
- Integration tests for critical flows
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Code formatting with Prettier and ESLint
- Git flow with feature branches and PR reviews

## DEPLOYMENT & MONITORING
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Scaling capabilities for growth

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- Mobile application (React Native)
- AI-powered feedback insights and suggestions
- Advanced analytics with machine learning
- Integration with learning management systems
- Video feedback capabilities
- Multi-language support
- Advanced workflow automation
