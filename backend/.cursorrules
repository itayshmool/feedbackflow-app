# AI Workflow & Communication Standards

## 1. Honest Status Reporting
- NEVER claim something is "complete" or "working" if it uses mock/placeholder data
- Always distinguish between:
  - ✅ What actually works end-to-end
  - ⚠️ What works partially (UI only, mock data, etc.)
  - ❌ What's not implemented yet
- Example: "Status: UI works ✅, Backend returns mock data ⚠️, Real DB query NOT implemented ❌"

## 2. Test Before Claiming Success
- Before marking ANY task as complete:
  1. Run actual test (API call, UI interaction, etc.)
  2. Show test results/evidence
  3. Verify it works with real data (not mocks)
- If testing reveals issues, report them immediately

## 3. Stop and Ask When Stuck
- When hitting errors/blockers:
  1. Stop immediately (don't hide with workarounds)
  2. Show the error clearly
  3. Present options: "Error X occurred. Should I: A) try to fix, B) skip feature, C) different approach?"
- NEVER use mock data as a workaround without explicit approval

## 4. Incremental Verification
For each feature:
1. **Plan** - Show what will be done
2. **Implement** - Make changes
3. **Test** - Actually test with evidence
4. **User Verify** - Wait for user confirmation
5. **Only Then** - Mark complete

## 5. Evidence-Based Claims
- Don't say "everything works" - show:
  - API response
  - Database query results
  - UI screenshot/behavior
  - Test output
- Backend logs showing successful queries
- Actual data returned (not mock)

## 6. One Thing at a Time
- Work on ONE small, testable piece
- Test that piece thoroughly
- Get user confirmation
- Then move to next piece
- Don't stack unverified changes

## 7. Clear Issue Reporting
When reporting problems:
- **What failed**: Specific action/test
- **Error**: Exact error message
- **Impact**: What doesn't work
- **Options**: 2-3 possible solutions
- **Recommendation**: Which option you suggest and why

## Examples

### Good Status Report:
```
✅ Frontend Team Feedback page loads
⚠️ Backend returns mock data (not real team members)
❌ Database query fails: "could not determine data type of parameter $1"
```

### Bad Status Report:
```
✅ Team Feedback feature complete and working
```

### Good Error Report:
```
❌ Database query error: "could not determine data type of parameter $1"
Impact: Team feedback shows empty list
Options: 
A) Fix parameter type casting in query
B) Use simpler query without parameters
C) Debug parameter values being passed
Recommendation: Option A - fix the type casting
```

### Evidence-Based Claim:
```
✅ API Test Results:
- Request: GET /api/v1/team/feedback
- Response: 200 OK
- Data: [{"id": "123", "giverName": "John Doe", ...}]
- Database logs: "Executed query { duration: 15ms, rows: 3 }"
```
